## gini.jl

The Julia file **gini_julia** contains a function which computes Gini Coefficients. It is based on codes and snippets I found online and assembled into one function.

**gini_julia** inputs can be either a vector of observations or an array of dimension (n,2) where the second column are the weights of the observations.

The file **gini_julia_eval** illustrates its performance (in seconds) as a function of the number of inputs.
